## Exercises

1. Define a default policy for deny all incoming message to the firewall.
   - Test with `ping` if the communications between all the hosts (*docker containers*) is denied.
   - In *cs-host-1* try `ping cs-host-2`. What is the result and why?
   - In *cs-host-1* try `ping cs-host-3`. What is the result and why?
2. Allow only **cs-host-1** for `ping` requests.
   - In *cs-host-1* try `ping cs-host-2`. What is the result and why?
   - In *cs-host-1* try `ping cs-host-3`. What is the result and why?
   - In *cs-host-1* try `ping 10.5.2.11`. What is the result and why?
3. Enable the *DNS* resolution for all the hosts (*docker containers*).
   - In *cs-host-1* try `ping cs-host-3`. What is the result and why?
